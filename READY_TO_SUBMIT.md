Live demonstration showing:
1. Natural language commands creating components
2. Real-time visual building
3. Complete React app export
4. Deployment readiness

### **Technical Excellence (45 seconds)**
"Built with React 18, TypeScript, and modern AI integration. Our platform generates production-ready code that developers would write, but accessible to complete beginners."

### **Market Impact (30 seconds)**
"We're democratizing web development for the 10 million non-technical founders who have great ideas but lack execution capability. This isn't just a tool - it's an innovation enabler."
