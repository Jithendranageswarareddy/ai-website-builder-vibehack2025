## 📝 **Presentation Script (3-5 minutes)**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
"Hi, I'm [Name] and we've built an AI-powered website builder that solves a critical problem for non-technical founders - the inability to create and deploy full-stack applications without coding knowledge."

### **Problem & Solution (1 minute)**
"Current tools like Webflow give you designs but not code ownership. AI tools like v0 generate code but lack visual building. We combine both - visual drag-and-drop with AI assistance that exports production-ready React applications."

### **Live Demo (2 minutes)**
1. Sign up in 10 seconds
2. Drag components to build a landing page
3. Use AI: "Add a contact form with email validation"
4. Preview responsive design
5. Export complete React application
6. Show deployment readiness

### **Technical Highlights (1 minute)**
"Built with React 18, TypeScript, and modern web standards. Features include real-time AI assistance, complete authentication system, database integration, and one-click deployment. Everything a startup needs to launch."

### **Future Impact (30 seconds)**
"This democratizes web development. Any founder with an idea can now build, deploy, and scale their vision without technical barriers. We're not just building websites - we're empowering innovation."
